# JSON Schema Editor (React + TailwindCSS + React Hook Form)

## Overview

This project is a JSON Schema Editor based on React. It allows users to visualize and edit the structure of a JSON schema without manually modifying the JSON code. By providing an intuitive interface, users can interact with JSON schemas more efficiently and reduce the chances of errors.

This project is a modified version of [json-schema-editor-antd](https://github.com/lin-mt/json-schema-editor-antd). The original project is built using Ant Design (antd), while this modified version replaces Ant Design components with TailwindCSS for styling and React Hook Form for form management. This ensures a more modern UI framework with a flexible and reactive form handling experience.

## Features

- ðŸ–¼ **Visual Schema Representation** â€“ Easily view and edit JSON schema structures without dealing with raw JSON code.
- ðŸŽ¨ **TailwindCSS** â€“ Lightweight styling with utility-first CSS.
- ðŸ”„ **React Hook Form** â€“ Efficient form management with minimal re-renders.
- ðŸ›  **Customizable** â€“ Extend and adapt the editor for different schema requirements.
- âš› **React-Based** â€“ Built on a modern React architecture.
